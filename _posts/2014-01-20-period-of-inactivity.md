 I must say that I am sorry of my inactivity :-). I've currently resumed my studies (MSc in Artificial Intelligence) so there
isn't so much spare time to write something decent (not much time for anything else at all) and I quite dislike idea of releasing
half-assed content.

If I manage to squeeze something out, it will probably be about "Tests as Specification" topic.
I have some other posts as drafts but they are too immature to be released now.


That's all folks!
