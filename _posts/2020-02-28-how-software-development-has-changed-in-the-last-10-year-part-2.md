This is continuation of the first part but while in the later I've 
focused more on the whole industry, this time I'll try to reflect
on how my own software development practices changed overtime.

If I had to point out one common pattern that I _try_ to 
adhere to, that would be "just make it simple". Make simple everything:
your code, your CI, DevOps. You can't be bother by worrying over
every little thing.


## Design: Keep It Stupid Simple
One important piece of advice that I can share is to not make code complicated. Make it easy to read.
Make it easy to understand.

I believe that all of the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
advice boils down to keeping it simple so if you want to take a shortcut here, it's really easy - 
just do no try to outsmart yourself and your colleagues.

For example, when [Law of Demeter](https://wiki.c2.com/?LawOfDemeter) is broken
```java
param1.getA().getB().getC(),
```
you can see right away that a simpler version ```paramC``` could be passed instead and automatically you
start following LoD (while we are here, I'll add a note that passing [Aggregate](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html)
is still OK).

## Make it easy to read and understand

Most likely, your code is gonna be written once and read many many times. So do not skimp on proper structure,
variable and function naming.

So instead of

```python
elem = object[2]
```

do 

```python
thirdPlayerInfo = recentlyVisitedPlayers[2]
```

Unless it's a scientific or a well-defined domain shorthand for a variable (like ```v = velocity```), always prefer the longer name.

## Premature Design
I think I've learned to stay away from premature abstractions. I'll expand on prototyping 
later but [premature optimization](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization)
is root of all evil. I believe this holds true for software design as well.

You have to understand that before you start coding and get your hands dirty (with code and business knowledge)
you are not qualified to make sound design decisions. So instead of shooting yourself in the foot, leave yourself
some flexibility by just implementing the simplest approach that works (that's a heuristic that works surprisingly
well).

That holds true for code (de)duplication as well. Sometimes it's just a simple string formatter that you can see
that will be used in many different places so it's natural to get it extracted. Sometimes it's a part of the process
that guides some other thing. Things are not so obvious in these cases and straightforward deduplication will
turn out to be a pain in the ass to maintain as you will start adding some boolean flags and parameters.

Some code might appear to do the same initially but later you will find that actually the process is different and 
unique. However, now you are stuck with "generalized" solution that isn't general nor easy to work with.

Quite often people go really crazy with **extends** and generics only to wind up with a code that's 
impossible to work with and doesn't bear any similarity to the domain.


## Avoid inheritance
After spending my fair share amount of time debugging some convoluted inheritance trees with less than appropriate uses
of [Template (anti-)pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern), I came to prefer 
[Composition-over-Inheritance](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/reusable-oo-composition-vs-inheritance) . 
You get more code duplication by adding all of those
delegation methods, but the straightforwardness, flexibility, and peace of mind that you are not breaking anything, more
than compensates for that.


## Avoid generics
They can get complex really fast if you don't keep them in check. You might say "But hey, I am developing a lock-free
collections library. I can't do without generics!". That's a fair use case - go ahead. 
However, if you are in the process of writing some general
data abstraction layer that "can be used by other teams as well", I have bad news for you. You gonna be lucky if actually anybody else
besides you reads that code and there is no need to commit to generics if you can avoid them.

In a nutshell, you don't really want to end up with something like this:

```java
public abstract class AbstractMessageLite<
    MessageType extends AbstractMessageLite<MessageType, BuilderType>,
    BuilderType extends AbstractMessageLite.Builder<MessageType, BuilderType>>
        implements MessageLite
```        

In reality, this is just another example of "avoiding premature optimization".


## Functional Programming
I guess my first experience with functional programming was JavaScript. At the time it was
really clunky and unrefined (my own approach and tools available). But you could do some currying
and cool local function declarations.

But there wasn't much appreciation until roughly these three things happened:
 * I've started doing Python,
 * I've learned [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki),
 * Java 8 was released.

Back in the day, Python ecosystem was one of the first (among major
programming languages) to encourage the use of functional programming (all
of those enumerates, zips, and yields).

Java 8 made working with functional code in Java much more pleasant.
 It included the first Stream
support and, most importantly, it was possible to write lambdas. Having learned RxJava
and its functional paradigm, I've started using functional programming quite often.

Functional programming doesn't really make sense if you are working with a mutating 
state, thus I've adopted [immutable](https://immutables.github.io/) 
[collection](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/) 
[libraries](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs). 

What's the result? I think my code became more straightforward to follow
and there are way less "strange" bugs that are usually caused by deep
state updates or some rogue uses
of the object.
Most of the resulting state is now a result of a pipeline
that just processes data.

Obviously, your entire program cannot really be functional and stateless as
it will probably won't solve any meaningful business problem.

My approach here is to use functional programming tactically. The big picture
(architecture) of 
the system is usually built following Domain Driven Design principles, but local
code (code in the methods) is usually functional. Here you have to be really pragmatic
as approaches available to you will be often guided by the frameworks and libraries
you gonna use.

In the end, I still feel noobish in this field and I would like to learn 
Haskell and/or Clojure in the next few years.


# Prototesting
One of the bigger changes happened the way I build, test and design software.
Majority of my current code is written as a result of not passing a test.
It's not quite TDD as they want to have no code written that's not a direct
result of making a test pass, but something not far from that.

First of all, whenever I am building APIs, I just write the resulting API
interface in the test in the way I would like to use it in a real program.
This way you get to play around with the result, before the actual code is designed.

After you end up with the code that would make you happy to use, you just autocomplete
and fill in the
gaps to make the test pass.

Later, when there is a new use case, some twist, or something that you missed - just
add as a new example/testcase.

This way most of the tests are basically integration tests, but that's the way I like it now.
Unit tests are often useless as they do not capture intricate interactions between
different components of the system. In the end, instead of your regular pyramid, you get

![Tests](/assets/images/tests.png)

In a regular pyramid, most of the code ends up testing the implementation instead
of the behavior. However, I am not completely against unit-testing as it has it's own
place. Usually, all of the highly specialized and complex functions deserve to have
unit tests (for example, email validation regexes :) ).

## Tests as documentation
Whenever I write tests now, I describe the wanted behavior in the test (somebody call it
 [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)).
It's rather straightforward. Instead of having

```java
@Test
void test2() {
    ...
}
```

write

```java
@Test
public void node_id_cards_should_apply_reverse_replacement_when_there_are_multiple_replacements() {
    ...
}
```

This way your tests will act as documentation whenever you come back to the project.

## Tests are the first-class part of your codebase
Another thing that I've realized is that tests are the first-class members of your codebase.

Treating your tests as some supplementary code is a sure way to shoot yourself in a foot. Tests need to be
maintained, updated, and refactored with the rest of the code.

If you are not going to spend time creating a pleasant testing environment, then testing won't happen 
because it just gonna be too difficult to write tests. It's going to get more and more difficult every time
you skip on creating or updating data preparation script or environment setup.

These days there are few excuses left not to have a proper testing environment when you have Docker, Vagrant,
and *docker-compose*.

## Refactor often
When there is a comprehensive test suite watching your back, it is extremely easy to refactor code. If tests aren't 
overengineered and if they focus on the behavior, there shouldn't be any problems following through with 
major refactorings.

Making big refactorings with ease have some major quality benefits to the codebase. Before, I've claimed that you won't 
probably have enough domain expertise to design the system properly. But that is not a problem anymore as your design
will evolve to match your ever increasing understanding of the domain. Less discrepancies between your code and
domain ~ less bugs and easier maintenance.

# More OOP
I've found myself using way more objects and classes. Every time there is a new concept, I try to introduce a class for it. 
Capture it explicitly.

For example, if there is a specific format for a player ID, then create it. Next time you use it in the Map, it is 
gonna be much clearer:

```java
Map<PlayerId, Player> idToPlayer = Maps.newHashMap();
```

And now, instead of upsetting your production environment with some random string, you will make the compiler complain about that right away.
Additionally, you will be able to add validation "for-free" just by updating the constructor.

Also, whenever I feel that I want to create a private method, I always consider if it should be a separate class instead.
Lots of private methods is a strong smell that your classes are trying to do too much.

## Avoid null ###
[Somebody](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/) called "null" the billion dollar mistake.
These days I wholeheartedly agree with that. Avoid them by using 
[Optional](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html) (most of the [modern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/)
 languages have similar alternatives)
or [Null-Object](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/null_object).



# My database is just a detail

After adopting DDD a while ago
and after having deployed a system using [EventSourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) and 
[CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html), it made me realize that database
is just a detail. An important detail, but still - just a detail.

These days database for me might as well be just a plain text file. It doesn't really matter. As all of the persistence 
will be abstracted away by [Repositories](https://airbrake.io/blog/software-design/domain-driven-design).
What only matters is that the state can be persisted and retrieved intact.

Also, not every Object deserves it's own table 
or collection, so it is important to decide what is a:
 * Value Object
 * Entity
 * Aggregate

Usually only Aggregates deserve to have a Repository for persistence.

If you feel that you couldn't live without advanced SQL queries, consider this:
how much it would take to query aggregate(s) on/after write,
process,
transform,
and dump (or not) it 
into a specific table that would act basically as a view?

I am not saying that SQL is evil but people depend too much
on the database capabilities. Quite often, they let the database centric
mindset creep in and compromise their
domain model (I was certainly used to be guilty of this).

# Outro
I feel that at this point it's already quite a bit 
for the reader and it's quite tiring to write up everything thoughtfully.
I haven't touched topics such as frontend development or DevOps 
which could be interesting.

 I hope that some of the engineers are going to relate to my experience and
 that maybe some of you are going to find this helpful (all those links and tips :) ).
