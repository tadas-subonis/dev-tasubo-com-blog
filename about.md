Hello.

I am Tadas Å ubonis and you have found my blog. In this particular place I write about 
my experiences as a software developer.

Usually I describe myself as a Software Craftsman and Data Scientist. My background is 
in Machine Learning and Statistics and I've worked as a sofware developer for several years now.

The knowledge that I've gained gives me a unique perspective to most of the problems and that's
what I love doing - solving problems with software and statistics.

Tadas
